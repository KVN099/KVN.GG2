                    <strong>Grand Theft Auto VI</strong> <br>
                    GTA VI is an upcoming video game in development by Rockstar Games. Easily the most widely anticipated launch expected in 2025,
                     It is due to be the eighth main Grand Theft Auto game, following Grand Theft Auto V (2013), and the sixteenth entry overall. 
                     Rockstar is returning to Vice City with a Bonnie and Clyde-inspired crime couple. This is set in the fictional open world state of 
                     Leonida based on Florida which includes Vice City, a fictionalised version of Miami.

                                    <p><strong>Ghost of Yōtei</strong></p>
                                    <p>With the recent announcement of Ghost of Yotei, the successor to Sucker Punch's 2020 hit Ghost of Tsushima, 
                                        players will once again be able to immerse themselves in a beautiful open world set in Japan's storied past. However,
                                         Ghost of Yotei is making some major changes from its predecessor, including a major time jump from 1274 to 1603,
                                          as well as a new protagonist and new location. While the game is sure to please fans of historical Japanese settings,
                                           Ghost of Yotei is in the odd position of not technically taking place in Japan while still carrying a distinctly Japanese
                                            aesthetic.</p>

                                    <p>Assassin's Creed Shadows is an upcoming action role-playing game developed by Ubisoft Quebec and published by Ubisoft.
                                        Set in 16th-century Japan towards the end of the Sengoku period, the game will focus on the millennia-old struggle of the Assassin Brotherhood,
                                        who fight for peace and liberty, and the Templar Order, who desire peace through control,
                                        from the perspective of two protagonists: Naoe, a female shinobi, and Yasuke,
                                        an African samurai inspired by the historical figure of the same name.
                                        The two characters control differently and provide a unique gameplay style, allowing quests to be approached in multiple ways.</p>

                                        Like other entries in the Dynasty Warriors series, Dynasty Warriors: Origins is based on the Chinese novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms.
                                        According to Director Tomohiko Sho, however, Origins differs from previous titles in that it only covers the first half of the novel while being more 
                                        thorough in telling the story.
